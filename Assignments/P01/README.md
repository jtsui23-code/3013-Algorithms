|--------:|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1       | Introduction           | What is Dinic's Algorithm?    | Define Dinic’s Algorithm, origin (Dinitz 1970), and classification as a network flow algorithm. Mention its improvement over Ford-Fulkerson. |
| 2       |                        | Why It Matters?               | Highlight the significance: efficient max flow computation, polynomial time for unit capacity graphs, used in networks, scheduling, and matching problems. |
| 3       | Core Mechanics         | High-Level Overview           | Describe phases: Level Graph construction (via BFS) and blocking flow computation (via DFS). |
| 4       |                        | Step-by-Step Walkthrough      | Use a small example graph and walk through: building level graph, finding blocking flows, updating residual graph. |
| 5       |                        | Code Snippet (Optional)       | (Optional) Pseudocode or Python/C++ snippet of BFS, DFS, and Main Loop. Keep simple and annotated. |
| 6       |                        | Edge Cases & Performance      | Discuss when it shines (unit capacities) vs when it’s less optimal. Time complexity: O(V²E) general, O(E√V) for unit capacities. |
| 7       | Use Cases / Impact     | Real-World Applications       | Matching in bipartite graphs, scheduling, image segmentation. Brief compare with Ford-Fulkerson / Edmonds-Karp. |
| 8       |                        | Summary                       | Recap: key ideas and where it fits in the big picture. |
| 9       | Wrap-Up / Q&A          | Questions or Discussion?      | Open floor for questions. Offer an insight prompt like "Where could this be used in real time systems?" |

## 📘 Key Concepts to Cover

- **Definition:** Dinic’s Algorithm is a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Phases:**
  1. **BFS:** Build level graph by layer.
  2. **DFS:** Find all blocking flows (no more augmenting paths in level graph).
  3. Repeat until no more paths exist from source to sink.
- **Complexity:**
  - General: O(V²E)
  - Unit capacity graphs: O(E√V)
- **Innovations:** Separation of levels via BFS improves edge disjoint augmenting path discovery.

## 📑 Use Cases

- Bipartite Matching (e.g., job scheduling)
- Network Routing (e.g., bandwidth allocation)
- Image Segmentation (e.g., min-cut problems)
- Project/task planning
