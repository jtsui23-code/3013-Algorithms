## üìò Key Concepts to Cover

- **Definition:** Dinic‚Äôs Algorithm is a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Phases:**
  1. **BFS:** Build level graph by layer.
  2. **DFS:** Find all blocking flows (no more augmenting paths in level graph).
  3. Repeat until no more paths exist from source to sink.
- **Complexity:**
  - General: O(V¬≤E)
  - Unit capacity graphs: O(E‚àöV)
- **Innovations:** Separation of levels via BFS improves edge disjoint augmenting path discovery.

## üìë Use Cases

- Bipartite Matching (e.g., job scheduling)
- Network Routing (e.g., bandwidth allocation)
- Image Segmentation (e.g., min-cut problems)
- Project/task planning
